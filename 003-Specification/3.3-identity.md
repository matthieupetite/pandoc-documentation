# Identity and access management

Identity provides the basis for a wide variety of security assurance. It grants access based on identity authentication and authorization controls in cloud services. Access control protects data and resources and helps decide which requests should be permitted.

The technological landscape in the enterprise is becoming complex and heterogenous. To manage compliance and security for this environment, identity and access management lets the right individuals access the right resources at the right time for the right reasons.

Identity and access management is boundary security in the public cloud. It must be treated as the foundation of any secure and fully compliant public cloud architecture. Azure offers a comprehensive set of services, tools, and reference architectures to help organizations make highly secure, operationally efficient environments.

## Identity requirements

| ID                               | Name                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------------  | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| OBS-AZ-IAM-002 | Klepierre must be able to manage Azure identity thought it’s on-premises Active Directory infrastructure.                          |
| OBS-AZ-IAM-003 | The number of groups added in Active Directory, used to manage the connectivity to Azure services must be limited.              |
| OBS-AZ-IAM-004 | Klepierre’s application developers that must have access to Azure services (i.e. Azure portal) must be declare in a specific group |
| OBS-AZ-IAM-005 | Klepierre’s IT members that must have access to Azure services (i.e. Azure portal) must be declare in a specific group             |
| OBS-AZ-IAM-006 | Sub-contractors must be declared in specific groups                                                                             |

## Identity Schema

The following figure presents the identity landing zone with its related resources

That landing zone is related to the governance one (used to defined policies). The main items build for that zone is role and right definition. Its purpose is to define who has the right to perform actions on specific scopes. In the Digital Service starterkit, the RBAC information are provided in the governance aera.

![Identity Zone Schema](./assets/3.3-identity/identity.png)

The first element involved in access right strategy is the user object and its related group objects. Azure provides a directory to define those elements called Azure Active Directory. To meet the project requirements, Klepierre’s administrators must not define users or groups in the Azure Active Directory but prefers to manage them through their on-premises Active Directory Forest.

This scenario is available by implementing the Azure Active Director Connect solution. This software synchronizes groups and users between Active Directory and Azure Active Directory in a bidirectional way.

![Azure AD Connect](./assets/3.3-identity/azureadconnect.png)

## Identity Description

The deployment of Azure Active Directory Connect is out of scope of this project and is under the responsibility of Klepierre IT Team. This chapter will also be focused on:
The list of users and groups that should be created on Klepierre’s Active Directory and sync to the Klepierre’s Azure Active Directory tenant.

To enable the DevOps deployment solution implemented in the project, Azure administrator must complementarily deploy Application’s resources dedicated to performing the Terraform “plan” and “apply” steps. With those applications resources comes Service Principal Identity. That chapter identify the list of those applications and the rights they must have across the enterprise scale architecture deployed for the Klepierre project.

## Applications

The following table presents the necessary applications that must be created in the Klepierre’s Azure Active directory.

| Zone              | Application (Service principal)    | Purpose                                                                                |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| Identity zone     | devops-kle-identity-default        | This application is used to manage resources in the identity production subscription   |
| Management zone   | devops-kle-management-default      | This application is used to manage resources in the management production subscription |
| Showup prod zone  | devops-kle-showup-default          | This application is used to manage resources in the showup production  subscription    |
| Showup dev zone   | devops-kle-showup-dev              | This application is used to manage resources in the showup development  subscription   |
| Connectivity zone | devops-kle-connectivity-default    | This application is used to manage resources in connectivity subscription              |
| Devops zone       | devops-kle-devops-default          | This application is used to manage resources in devops production subscription         |

: Applications for Zones

Two additional applications will be reused (already deployed in Azure Active Directory) to be able to use the Digital Service Starter kit.

| Application (Service principal)                       | Purpose                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------|
| devops-kle-governance-default                      | This application is used to deploy the Governance configuration of the tenant (Azure Policies and RBAC).|
| devops-kle-launchpad-default                       | This application is used to deploy the first cloud storage and necessary resources used by terraform engine. It must be declared owner on the devops subscription. |

: Additionnal Applications

The creation of those applications is part of the starterkit initialization process and is fully automated.

The usage of the launchpad application is mandatory as it is part of the Digital Service Starter Kit. To have more information on that, please refers to the Devops Chapter of this document.

## Custom roles

Two roles will be used in the Azure Active Directory tenant:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| DSI Finance Fonctionnal     | Klepierre function DSI team member in charge of finance business unit  |

:Azure Groups

The groups creation process is under the responsibility of Klepierre’s IT Team through the configuration of the Azure Active Directory Team Connect tools.
Those groups must be created before the deployment of the Orange Business starter kit.

## Management RBAC Rules

The table below presents the list of right attributions for groups at management group level:

| Management Group    | Groups                      | Roles                     |

: Management group - groups rights

This rights model is designed to meet Klepierre to have few user groups declare across its tenant. It’s part of the Digital Service to develop terraform scripts to create that right affectation but, filling group with users is under the responsibility of Klepierre IT Team.

## Subscriptions RBAC Rules

At subscription level, the rights are only given to Application in order to enable the possibility to deploy Azure resources through terraform. At subscription level, no user specific rights should be deployed, only those for application can be set by convention.

| Subscription     | Application                     | Roles                    |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------- |
| sub-connectivity | devops-kle-connectivity-default | Contributor              |
| sub-connectivity | devops-kle-connectivity-default | User Access Administrator|
| sub-devops       | devops-kle-devops-default       | Contributor              |
| sub-devops       | devops-kle-devops-default       | User Access Administrator|
| sub-identity     | devops-kle-identity-default     | Contributor              |
| sub-identity     | devops-kle-identity-default     | User Access Administrator|
| sub-management   | devops-kle-management-default   | Contributor              |
| sub-management   | devops-kle-management-default   | User Access Administrator|
| sub-showup-prod  | devops-kle-showup-prod          | Contributor              |
| sub-showup-prod  | devops-kle-showup-prod          | User Access Administrator|
| sub-showup-dev   | devops-kle-showup-dev           | Contributor              |
| sub-showup-dev   | devops-kle-showup-dev           | User Access Administrator|

: Subscription rights per service principal

The subscription RBAC Rules are deployed automatically by Digital Service Starter kit.

## Specific RBAC Rules for resources

To follow the least privilege right strategy, the Digital Service need to specify rights at resources level. The table below present those rights:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
