# Datascience Landing Zone

We will present here the architecture of the datascience platform landing zone, outlining the critical components and design principles that ensure its robustness and flexibility.

## Business objectives

The business objectives of the data platform are:

- Centralized Data Science Team: Provide best practices, tooling, and cross-entity project execution to generate business value through data analytics and data science.
- Scalability: Ensure the solution is scalable to accommodate increasing data volumes.
- Security and Compliance: Adhere to strict security requirements, ensuring all access is restricted to company employees and complies with industry regulations such as GDPR.
- Budget Constraint: Operate within a $50k/year budget for three environments (hors production, pre production, production).
