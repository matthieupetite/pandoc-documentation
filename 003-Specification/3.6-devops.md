## Devops Schema

The schema bellow presents the Devops landing zone architecture under the reponsability of the April Service Delivery team. That zone will hosts
the terraform launchpad (a.k.a. the terraform state) but specific runners will be deployed in the datascience landing zone to host the CI/CD pipelines
dedicated to the data science projects (infrastructure and applications).
