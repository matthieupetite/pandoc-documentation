: Management groups and subscription requirements

### Schema

The following schema illustrates the management groups and subscriptions and organizations in the Klepierre’s Tenant.

![Management Groups Schema](./assets/3.2-governance/management-groups.png)

### Description

The management group topology is a 6-level group tree. This group hierarchy allows aggregating policies and initiatives assignments via Azure Policy and 
allows deploying the RBAC authorizations easily across the tenant.

The table below presents each level of management group’s hierarchy in the perimeter of the project.

| Level | Management Group                       | Sample value         | Management group level description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Tenant Root level                      | Tenant Root Group    | Root of the management group tree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 1     | Company level                          | mg-klepierre         | This level is created here for future needs. If Klepierre needs to create a separate structure for management groups for testing purpose, having that level will permit performing those actions without impact on the production side.                                                                     |
| 2     | Enterprise Scale Structure main level  | mg-platform          | That management group level separates the core landing zones from those dedicated to the applications or subsidiaries landing zones. That separation of concern gives the ability to declare specific policy regarding the critical landing zones (the core one) and others for applications landing zones. |
| 3     | Enterprise Scale Structure sub level 1 | mg-prod              | For core landing zones: This level is used to separate the different domain of responsibility related to the core landing zones such as the IAM, the management, the DevOps part,… For applications landing zones: That level is dedicated to environment type.                                             |
| 4     | Enterprise Scale Structure sub level 2 | mg-exploitation-prod | Only used for applications landing zones. That level is dedicated to separate the platform per business unit.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 5     | Enterprise Scale Structure sub level 3 | mg-showup-prod       | Only used for applications landing zones. That level is dedicated to separate the projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

: Subscriptions list

Note: All other subscriptions are out of the scope of this document. Nevertheless, it is recommended for Klepierre to follow the same naming guidelines when adding new subscriptions.

Here is the Subscription Id Table:

## Security governance and compliance

This critical design area establishes the policies to be put in place as well as their respective scope.

### Project requirements

The project requirements related to the security and compliance are listed in the following table.

### Description

Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.

Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. Policy definitions for these common use cases are already available in your Azure environment as built-ins to help you get started.

The description of Azure policy can be found here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overvi
