# Generated solution presentation

## Git Repositories Overview

The project is based on various git repositories that concur together to store the project code-based as defined in the [Git Ops Strategy](../2-git-usage-in-the-project.md)

Here is the full list of repositories created when you deploy a solution (except for the basic one and the empty one which are light solution for poc)

## Few word about the manifest files

At each time of the lifecycle of an environment we need to know which version of the infrastructure is deployed for a specific environment.

The table below present what we need to know to have a good observability of what is deployed on azure

| Date       | Version                        | Comments                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|
| 01/01/2025 | environement version: v0.0.1   | initial commit for both environment and infrastructure                                         |
|            | infrastructure version: v0.0.1 |                                                                                                |
| 02/01/2025 | environement version: v0.0.2   | that day only a change was performed on the variables . No impact on the infrastructure itself |
|            | infrastructure version: v0.0.1 |                                                                                                |
| 03/01/2025 | environement version: v0.0.3   | That day a new version of the infrastructure was created with majors change.                   |
|            | infrastructure version: v0.0.2 | A new version of the enviroment was also release to deploy that envrionemnt                    |

: versionning between infrastructure repo and environment repo

In each environment repository a specific file helps to track that link between the environment version and the infrastructure version which is called the manifest file.

This file is located at the root of each environment repository : **manifest.json**

here are a sample of the file

```json
{
  "environmentName": "<environement name>",
  "projectName": "<project name>",
  "cloudProviders": {
    "azure": {
      "REGION": "<azure region where the tfstate lives>",
      "ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID": "<azure subscription where the tfstate lives>",
      "ARM_TENANT_ID": "<tenant id>"
    }
  },
  "tooling": {
    "url": "<url of the git repository of the tooling code>",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "infrastructure": {
    "tag": "v0.0.1",
    "url": "<url of the git repository of the infrastructure code>"
  },
  "environment": {
    "url": "<url of the git repository of the environement code>",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Pipeline strategy

You will find here a short description of what is doing each pipeline on each repository.

On merge request, each pipeline is simply performing tests on the code based.

When the merge request is accepted, each pipeline performs  a release:

- automatic versioning work (update the version in package.json file)
- tag the repository.

Depending on the repository type, the merge request can also trigger various actions.

| repo category   | commit on MR branches                 | Merge on main                                                              |

## Environment repository topology

### Objective of this repository

This repository is dedicated to store each environment terraform configuration files (backend and variable) for each landing zone. It also provides the project with
the definition of the CI/CD pipeline that enables the deployment on hyperscaler.
